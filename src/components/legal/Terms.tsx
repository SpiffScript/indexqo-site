            technical support, advisory, audit, diagnostic, implementation,
            content, analytics, domain, or related professional services
            (collectively, the “Services”) provided by IndexQo, a business
            operated by QoLogic LLC (“IndexQo,” “QoLogic,” “we,” “us,” or “our”).

            By accessing or using the Site or engaging IndexQo, you agree to be
            bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, you must not use the Site
            or Services.
          </p>

          <p>
            Certain Services may be governed by additional written agreements,
            including proposals, statements of work (“SOW”), or engagement
            letters. In the event of a conflict, the executed written agreement
            controls only the specific Services covered.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-12">1. Eligibility</h2>
          <p>
            The Site and Services are intended solely for business and
            professional use. You represent that you are at least eighteen (18)
            years of age and have authority to bind the organization you

            2. Advisory Role Only; No Fiduciary Duty
          </h2>
          <p>
            IndexQo provides Services in an advisory and implementation-support
            capacity only. IndexQo does not act as a fiduciary, regulator,
            compliance authority, auditor, attorney, accountant, financial
            advisor, or decision-maker for your business.
          </p>

          <p>
            No relationship created by these Terms or any engagement gives rise
            to fiduciary duties, duties of loyalty, or duties of care beyond
            those expressly stated in a written agreement.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-12">

            marketing strategy, and implementation of any advice received.

          <p>
            Decisions made following or in reliance upon IndexQo’s guidance
            remain entirely your responsibility, even where guidance is

            platforms, including search engines, ad networks, social platforms,
            hosting providers, registrars, or analytics providers. Rankings,
